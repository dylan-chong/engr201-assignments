Since social media is a popular medium for sharing fake news *TODO needs
source*[], censoring fake news may appear be the the most obvious way to
prevent the above issue. However, as this article discusses, censorship of fake
news on social media is not a the most desirable solution.

This report discusses pros and cons of censoring fake news, while taking a
stance against censorship. The reasons for fake news popularity are also
discussed. These lead to reasons why education about fake news is the
recommended, long-term solution to this fake news problem.

This report is intended to inform governments, social media companies, and
members of the public who are interested in solving the fake news problem.

(Note: Any uses of the term 'censorship' from this point forward refers to the
censorship of fake news on social media, unless specified otherwise.)

# Analysis

This section discusses some pros and some noteworthy cons of censorship.
Lastly, reasons for the popularity of fake news are discussed in order to
provide a basis for the alternative solution of education about fake news.

## Pros of Censorship

The spreading of fake news has malicious motivations and insights hateful
behaviour/thinking. Censorship would help with both of these problems.

### Preventing Malicious Motivations

There are two main motivations for fake news: political and financial. This
subsection discusses why these motivations are malicious, and how censorship
could help to reduce these.

#### - Motivations for Fake News

The main motivation for the creation and spread of fake news is the advertising
revenue on fake news websites [8]. This is malicious because the goal of
maximising revenue is not aligned with the goal of choosing an effective
party/candidate.

Fake news around the time of the 2016 US Presidential Election was heavily in
favour of Trump [8]. The fact that the Republicans/Trump won the election
raises the concern that fake news affected the election.

Both financial and political motivations for fake news are malicious because a
party can be elected for false reasons, not for their true ability to run a
country. True information about a party can easily be discredite by the false
information. This makes it harder for citizens to make and accurate decision
about who to vote for in an election.

#### - How Censorship Could Help

Considering that some fake news articles were more popular than mainstream news
articles on Facebook, it is clear that fake news affects a significant number
of people on social media [8]. Without some method to prevent the fake news
from spreading, such as censorship, fake news will likely continue to be
exploited for political and financial motivations.

Assuming that a large enough number of fake articles can be accurately
identified, social media companies could remove all posts containing a link to
the fake articles. Given the popularity of the fake articles on Facebook [8],
this form of censorship would certainly slow the spread. This would reduce the
advertising revenue gained from fake news, therefore reducing financial
motivations. It would also likely reduce the effectiveness in terms of boosting
the popularity of a party/candidate.

### Prevention of Hateful Behaviour

Fake news can incite hateful thinking or behaviour. For example, the Las Vegas
shooting in October 2017 led to fake news to be spread about the shooting
\[12], \[13]. Among the fake news, there were false accusations that Geary
Danley was the killer [13]. The Gateway Pundit, a blog, labelled Mr. Danley "a
far left loon" [12]. These led to death threats being sent to the family
of Mr. Danley [13]. Censorship may have been able to prevent the fake news from
spreading and causing these threats to be sent.

## Cons of Censorship

Although there are benefits to censorship there are two main reasons why
censorship may not be a good idea. Firstly, there is a great potential for bias
in a process that decides what news is visible to the public. Secondly, it
*may* not be financially viable for social media companies to cooperate with
the censorship.

### Potential for Biased or Corrupted Censorship

*TODO After*
<!--
- Potential for bias
    - Mention facebook fact checking bias
    - Mention china
    - bribe from fake news sources
-->

### Financial Effect of Censorship on Social Media Companies
*TODO change to why effective censorship is not practical
(
- personal posts tweets must be censored - censoring them would be/heads towards
an invasion of free speech.
- too much data to censor, especially if you include personal posts
- fake news spreads too fast (TODO needs research) for the information to be
researched thoroughly to determine censorship
    - takes weeks to research
)
TODO if i go through with this then change the introduction and introduction to
analysis/cons section
end*

<!--
- Social media companies are not likely to cooperate with censorship because it
reduces advertising revenue.
    - fact checking also costs money
        - especially for accuracy, and multiple fact checkers
    - Impractical to accurately censor only fake news on internet (too much to
    filter)
-->

## Why Fake News is so Popular

<!--
- Lead up to education, and why fake news has an effect
- TODO why is it?
    - mention emotional reaction to fake news
-->

# Education as an Alternative Solution

*TODO censorship is not recommended primarily because of the possibility of
corruption*
*TODO education is the recommended solution*

<!--
- Education is a better long-term solution to the fake news problem

    - Mention how this avoids the bias problem
    - addresses the jo cos murder (hateful)
- Maybe mention the facts checking system has promise
-->

Other points
- Social media censorship does not prevent all fake news from propagating on
the internet
- Fake news is not completely inhibited on the internet - too much freedom
