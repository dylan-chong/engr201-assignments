# Introduction

*TODO Mention election influence, large amount of pro-trump fake news

Since social media is a popular medium for sharing fake news *TODO needs
source*[], censoring fake news may appear be the the most obvious way to
prevent the above issue. However, as this article discusses, censorship of fake
news on social media is not a the most desirable solution.

This report discusses pros and cons of censoring fake news, while taking a
stance against censorship. The reasons for fake news popularity are also
discussed. These lead to reasons why education about fake news is the
recommended, long-term solution to this fake news problem.

This report is intended to inform governments, social media companies, and
members of the public who are interested in solving the fake news problem.

(Note: Any uses of the term 'censorship' from this point forward refers to the
censorship of fake news on social media, unless specified otherwise.)

# Analysis

This section discusses some pros and some noteworthy cons of censorship.
Lastly, reasons for the popularity of fake news are discussed in order to
provide a basis for the alternative solution of education about fake news.

## Pros of Censorship

The spreading of fake news has malicious motivations and insights hateful
behaviour/thinking. Censorship would help with both of these problems.

### Preventing Malicious Motivations

There are two main motivations for fake news: political and financial. This
subsection discusses why these motivations are malicious, and how censorship
could help to reduce these.

#### - Motivations for Fake News

The main motivation for the creation and spread of fake news is the advertising
revenue on fake news websites (@fakeNewsStudy). This is malicious because the
goal of maximising revenue is not aligned with the goal of choosing an
effective party/candidate.

Fake news around the time of the 2016 US Presidential Election was heavily in
favour of Trump (@fakeNewsStudy). The fact that the Republicans/Trump won the
election raises the concern that fake news affected the election.

Both financial and political motivations for fake news are malicious because a
party can be elected for false reasons, not for their true ability to run a
country. True information about a party can easily be discredite by the false
information. This makes it harder for citizens to make and accurate decision
about who to vote for in an election.

#### - How Censorship Could Help

Considering that some fake news articles were more popular than mainstream news
articles on Facebook, it is clear that fake news affects a significant number
of people on social media (@fakeNewsStudy). Without some method to prevent the
fake news from spreading, such as censorship, fake news will likely continue to
be exploited for political and financial motivations.

Assuming that a large enough number of fake articles can be accurately
identified, social media companies could remove all posts containing a link to
the fake articles. Given the popularity of the fake articles on Facebook
(@fakeNewsStudy), this form of censorship would certainly slow the spread. This
would reduce the advertising revenue gained from fake news, therefore reducing
financial motivations. It would also likely reduce the effectiveness in terms
of boosting the popularity of a party/candidate.

### Prevention of Hateful Behaviour

Fake news can incite hateful thinking or behaviour. For example, the Las Vegas
shooting in October 2017 led to fake news to be spread about the shooting
\[12], \[13]. Among the fake news, there were false accusations that Geary
Danley was the killer [13]. The Gateway Pundit, a blog, labelled Mr. Danley "a
far left loon" [12]. These led to death threats being sent to the family
of Mr. Danley [13]. Censorship may have been able to prevent the fake news from
spreading and causing these threats to be sent.

## Cons of Censorship

Although there are benefits to censorship, there are two main reasons why
censorship may not be a good idea. Firstly, there is a great potential for bias
in a process that decides what news is visible to the public. Secondly, it
*may* not be financially viable for social media companies to cooperate with
the censorship.

### Potential for Biased or Corrupted Censorship

The potential for bias and corruption is both a short and long-term concern
about fake news censorship on social media. A bias in Facebook's fact checking
system, the corrupt censorship system in China, and the potential for future
biases will be discussed.

#### - Facebook's Fact Checking System Bias

In response to the fake news problem during the 2016 US Presidential Election,
Facebook created a fact checking system. Facebook users can request an article
to be checked by independent organisations such as Politifact. If the fact
checking organisation(s) determine that the article is fake, a 'disputed' space
warning is displayed on the article for everyone to see [9], [10].

Facebook has recently been accused of only using left-leaning fact checkers
[9]. This shows that it is quite easy for a single organisation to create a
bias, whether it is accidental or not.

If the fact checking system had been a censorship system instead, this bias
could have had notable implications. A censorship system would have greater
implications than a fact-checking system because it involves choosing what
information people will be able to see. The system could be exploited to affect
people's beliefs, e.g. sway some right-wing citizens to become more left-wing.

#### - Corrupt Censorship System in China

#### - Potential For Future Biases

**TODO NExt mention bribes from fake news sources**
**TODO AFTER figure out how to do references**

### Financial Effect of Censorship on Social Media Companies

*TODO change to why effective censorship requires filtering through too much
data
(
- too much data to censor, especially if you include personal posts
- personal posts tweets must be censored - censoring them would be/heads towards
an invasion of free speech.

Separate point:
- fake news spreads too fast (TODO needs research) for the information to be
researched thoroughly to determine censorship
    - takes weeks to research
)
TODO if i go through with this then change the introduction and introduction to
analysis/cons section

## Why Fake News is so Popular

<!--
- Lead up to education, and why fake news has an effect
- TODO why is it?
    - mention emotional reaction to fake news
-->

# Education as an Alternative Solution

*TODO censorship is not recommended primarily because of the possibility of
corruption*
*TODO education is the recommended solution*

<!--
- Education is a better long-term solution to the fake news problem

    - Mention how this avoids the bias problem
    - addresses the jo cos murder (hateful)
- Maybe mention the facts checking system has promise
-->
