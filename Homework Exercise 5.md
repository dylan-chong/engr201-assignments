# Notes

- Introduces the case
    - randsomware
        - prevent access to files (e.g. by encrypting them)
        - demands payment to decrypt
        - often spread to large number of users, in cases below they are able
        to spread themselves
    - mention impact
        - Wannacry
            - “Shut down work” at 16 hospitals in UK [2]
                - Unable to access medical records
                - “At least one hospital had to cancel all non-urgent
                operations”
                - Affected 45k computers worldwide
        - NotPetya
            - US hospitals affected, at least one surgery postponed 
            - 'Compromised' drug company network, and a law firm
- show some uncertainty - to lead on
    - There are multiple ways to protect organisations, such as hospitals, from
    such attacks.
- This case study will discuss:
    - for each rw
        - Why the vulnerabilities existed / why they could be exploited
        - how the randsomware spread
    - and ways organisations like Wellington Hospital can protect itself
    against such attacks.

# Introduction - Randsomware Threat At Wellington Hospital

Randsomware such as Wannacry, NotPetya, and Locky prevent access to computer
files, often by encrypting the files, and demanding a payment to decrypt them.
They often spread, automatically, affecting a large number of users.

Wannacry affected at least 45,000 computers, and was able to prevent work at
least 16 hospitals in the United Kingdom this year since medical records could
not be accessed [2]. NotPetya affected hospitals in the United States,
postponing at least one surgery, and affecting the Merk drug company's
computer network [4]. Several government agencies in the Ukraine were affected
[4].

This case study will discuss: why the vulnerabilities, used by Wannacry,
NotPetya and Locky, existed; how they forementioned randsomware spread; and
ways organisations like Wellington Hospital can protect itself against such
attacks.
